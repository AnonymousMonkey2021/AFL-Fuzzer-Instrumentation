# AFL-Fuzzer-Instrumentation
Instrumenting AFL Fuzzer to display intermediate execution information. 

For better understanding of AFL Fuzzer, I am planning on inserting some code into the original AFL fuzzer source code for recording all the fuzzed inputs locally. So I can read the difference between each generated input and see what has been modified using what fuzzing technique. 

While AFL fuzzer website provides a lot of very detailed documentations, this would help me with better understanding the implementation details of AFL fuzzer.
